### why we shuffle data sets in ML ?
To avoid any type of patterns or bias.
### What is the stratified sampling ?
Aims at splitting a data set so that each split is similar with respect to something. In a classification setting, it is often chosen to ensure that the train and test sets have approximately the same percentage of samples of each target class as the complete set.
### what are the skewed data sets ?
when some classes are much more frequent than others in the data set

### Precision and Recall
**Precision:** is the percentage of correctly predicted positive(TP) from all the **predicted** positive(TP+FP), so it's formula is TP/(TP+FP)

**Recall:** is the percentage of correctly predicted positive(TP) from all the  **actual** positive(TP+FN), so it's formula is TP/(TP+FN)
