# p-value:
 is actually the probability of getting a sample like ours.
High p-value: means it's more likely to have a sample like ours
(not strange).

**A small p-value**: (typically â‰¤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against
the null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis.

**A large p-value**: (> 0.05) indicates weak evidence against the null
hypothesis, so you fail to reject the null hypothesis.

**Null hypothesis**: the hypothesis that there is no significant difference
between specified populations, any observed difference being due to
sampling or experimental error.

### conclusion:
so in backward elimination when we say that we will remove
the predictor with the highest p-value if it's greater than sl (0.05)
that because it means that the predictor is similar to the others.  
**In other words:** we remove predictors
with the highest p-value because we **failed** to reject the null hypothesis ( there is no significant difference
between specified populations ).
